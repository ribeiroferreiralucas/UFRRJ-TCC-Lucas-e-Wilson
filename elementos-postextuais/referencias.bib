It addresses two common scenarios in collaborative filtering: rating pre- diction (e.g. on a scale of 1 to 5 stars) and item prediction from positive-only implicit feedback (e.g. from clicks or pur- chase actions). The library offers state-of-the-art algorithms for those two tasks. Programs that expose most of the li- brary's functionality, plus a GUI demo, are included in the package. Efficient data structures and a common API are used by the implemented algorithms, and may be used to im- plement further algorithms. The API also contains methods for real-time updates and loading/storing of already trained recommender models. MyMediaLite is free/open source software, distributed un- der the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). Its methods have been used in four different industrial field trials of the MyMedia project, including one trial involving over 50,000 households.},

% @article{Recommetz,
% abstract = {Recommender systems are used to provide filtered information from a large amount of elements. They provide personalized recommendations on products or services to users. The recommendations are intended to provide interesting elements to users. Recommender systems can be developed using different techniques and algorithms where the selection of these techniques depends on the area in which they will be applied. This paper proposes a recommender system in the leisure domain, specifically in the movie showtimes domain. The system proposed is called RecomMetz, and it is a context-aware mobile recommender system based on Semantic Web technologies. In detail, a domain ontology primarily serving a semantic similarity metric adjusted to the concept of "packages of single items" was developed in this research. In addition, location, crowd and time were considered as three different kinds of contextual information in RecomMetz. In a nutshell, RecomMetz has unique features: (1) the items to be recommended have a composite structure (movie theater + movie + showtime), (2) the integration of the time and crowd factors into a context-aware model, (3) the implementation of an ontology-based context modeling approach and (4) the development of a multi-platform native mobile user interface intended to leverage the hardware capabilities (sensors) of mobile devices. The evaluation results show the efficiency and effectiveness of the recommendation mechanism implemented by RecomMetz in both a cold-start scenario and a no cold-start scenario.},

% abstract="The emergence of ubiquitous computing as a new design paradigm poses significant challenges for human-computer interaction (HCI) and interaction design. Traditionally, HCI has taken place within a constrained and well-understood domain of experience---single users sitting at desks and interacting with conventionally-designed computers employing screens, keyboards and mice for interaction. New opportunities have engendered considerable interest in ``context-aware computing''---computational systems that can sense and respond to aspects of the settings in which they are used. However, considerable confusion surrounds the notion of ``context''---what it means, what it includes and what role it plays in interactive systems. This paper suggests that the representational stance implied by conventional interpretations of ``context'' misinterprets the role of context in everyday human activity, and proposes an alternative model that suggests different directions for design.",

% @article{Linden2003,
% abstract = {Background and Objectives: There is currently an epidemic of malignant melanoma occurring in the United States. At the same time there has been a heightened awareness for early detection of melanoma in the professional ranks as well as in the lay population. A database review was performed to investigate the changing patterns of melanoma presentation during a 2 decade time period in the State of Florida. Methods: This report is based on data collected in a prospective fashion from three institutions that shared a single melanoma database initially established in 1987. Four 5-year time periods were arbitrarily selected for the study: 1989-1993, 1994-1998, 1999-2003, and 2004-2008. Patients were grouped by their date of initial diagnosis. Results: A total of 7,580 patients were registered in the database during the study intervals. Multiple group comparisons by Chi-Square analysis showed that there were significant differences among the four groups in tumor thickness at diagnosis, stage of disease at diagnosis and disease-free survival (DFS). The DFS rate for all patients diagnosed with melanoma has progressively improved over the last 20 years (P {\textless} 0.0001). Conclusions: Even though there is an epidemic of malignant melanoma occurring in the United States, it appears that patients are being diagnosed earlier with thinner lesions that are capable of being cured with simple surgical techniques. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

% abstract = {Recommender systems try to predict users' preferences for certain items, given a set of historical data. Multiple different techniques are available that make these systems accurate and one of them that delivers promising results is matrix factorization. This thesis explores how these systems work and presents a method to incorporate contextual data into a factorization tech- nique to get predictions based on context. Specifically, a music recommender based on Candecomp/Parafac tensor factorization is proposed that uses im- plicit feedback collected from music listeners. The results are empirically tested and compared with other non-contextual recommender techniques. The prediction quality of the matrix factorization technique is unfortunately not improved by our proposed tensor factorization recommender on the used Last.fm dataset. However, an adjusted dataset with artificially made con- textual data does get better results, but this may not reflect a real-world situation. =},

% abstract = {Search and recommendation systems must include contextual information to effectively model users' interests. In this paper, we present a systematic study of the effectiveness of five variant sources of contextual information for user interest modeling. Post-query navigation and general browsing behaviors far outweigh direct search engine interaction as an information-gathering activity. Therefore we conducted this study with a focus on Website recommendations rather than search results. The five contextual information sources used are: social, historic, task, collection, and user interaction. We evaluate the utility of these sources, and overlaps between them, based on how effectively they predict users' future interests. Our findings demonstrate that the sources perform differently depending on the duration of the time window used for future prediction, and that context overlap outperforms any isolated source. Designers of Website suggestion systems can use our findings to provide improved support for post-query navigation and general browsing behaviors.},

% abstract = {Personalised recommender systems aim to help users access and retrieve relevant information or items from large collections, by automatically finding and suggesting products or services of likely interest based on observed evidence of the users‟ preferences. For many reasons, user preferences are difficult to guess, and therefore re- commender systems have a considerable variance in their success ratio in estimating the user‟s tastes and interests. In such a scenario, self-predicting the chances that a recommendation is accurate before actually submitting it to a user becomes an interesting capability from many perspectives. Performance prediction has been studied in the context of search engines in the Information Retrieval field, but there is little if any prior research of this problem in the recommendation domain. This thesis investigates the definition and formalisation of performance prediction methods for recommender systems. Specifically, we study adaptations of search performance predictors from the Information Retrieval field, and propose new predictors based on theories and models from Information Theory and Social Graph Theory. We show the instantiation of information-theoretical performance prediction methods on both rating and access log data, and the application of social-based predictors to social network structures. Recommendation performance prediction is a relevant problem per se, because of its potential application to many uses. Thus, we primarily evaluate the quality of the proposed solutions in terms of the correlation between the predicted and the observed performance on test data. This assessment requires a clear recommender evaluation methodology against which the predictions can be contrasted. Given that the evaluation of recommender systems is an open area to a significant extent, the thesis addresses the evaluation methodology as a part of the researched problem. We analyse how the variations in the evaluation procedure may alter the apparent behaviour of performance predictors, and we propose approaches to avoid misleading observations. In addition to the stand-alone assessment of the proposed predictors, we re- search the use of the predictive capability in the context of one of its common applications, namely the dynamic adjustment of recommendation methods and components. We research approaches where the combination leans towards the algorithm or the component that is predicted to perform best in each case, aiming to enhance the performance of the resulting dynamic configuration. The thesis reports positive empirical evidence confirming both a significant predictive power for the proposed methods in different experiments, and consistent improvements in the performance of dynamic recommenders employing the proposed predictors.},

% abstract="When humans talk with humans, they are able to use implicit situational information, or context, to increase the conversational bandwidth. Unfortunately, this ability to convey ideas does not transfer well to humans interacting with computers. In traditional interactive computing, users have an impoverished mechanism for providing input to computers. By improving the computer's access to context, we increase the richness of communication in human-computer interaction and make it possible to produce more useful computational services. The use of context is increasingly important in the fields of handheld and ubiquitous computing, where the user?s context is changing rapidly. In this panel, we want to discuss some of the research challenges in understanding context and in developing context-aware applications.",

% abstract="With the rapid growth of socio-technical ecosystems, smart interactions and services are permeating every walk of life. As smart interactions must managed automatically and interactively in response to evolving user's matters of concern, the smart Internet requires creative approaches where services and interactions are implemented with awareness of, and dynamic adaptation to, users, computational environments, changing policies and unknown requirements. Consequently, modeling and managing dynamic context is critical for implementing smart services and smart interactions effectively. Thus, smart interactions need infrastructure to acquire, compose, and distribute context information to multiple execution endpoints. Moreover, context management must be controlled and governed to optimize system properties. This chapter surveys context modeling and management approaches intended for the optimization of smart interactions and services, discusses the main challenges and requirements of context-awareness in the smart Internet, and provides a feature-based framework useful for the evaluation and implementation of context modeling and management mechanisms.",
